            <p class="intro">I got my first real six-string<br>
            Bought it at the five and dime<br>
            Played it 'til my fingers bled<br>
            Was the summer of '69</p>

            <p>Me and some guys from school<br>
            Had a band and we tried real hard<br>
            Jimmy quit, Jody got married<br>
            Should've known we'd never get far</p>

            <p>Oh, when I look back now<br>
            That summer seemed to last forever<br>
            And if I had the choice<br>
            Yeah, I'd always wanna be there<br>
            Those were the best days of my life</p>

            <p>Ain't no use in complainin'<br>
            When you got a job to do<br>
            Spent my evenin's down at the drive-in<br>
            And that's when I met you</p>

            <p>Standin' on your mama's porch<br>
            You told me that you'd wait forever<br>
            Oh, and when you held my hand<br>
            I knew that it was now or never<br>
            Those were the best days of my life</p>

            <p class="chorus">Oh, yeah<br>
            Back in the summer of '69</p>

            <p>Man, we were killin' time<br>
            We were young and restless<br>
            We needed to unwind<br>
            I guess nothin' can last forever<br>
            Forever, no</p>

            <p>And now the times are changin'<br>
            Look at everything that's come and gone<br>
            Sometimes when I play that old six-string<br>
            I think about you, wonder what went wrong</p>

            <p class="chorus">Standin' on your mama's porch<br>
            You told me that you'd wait forever<br>
            Oh, and when you held my hand<br>
            I knew that it was now or never<br>
            Those were the best days of my life<br>
            Oh, yeah<br>
            Back in the summer of '69</p>

            <p class="outro">Oh, oh<br>
            It was the summer of '69<br>
            Oh, oh<br>
            Yeah, it was the summer of '69</p>
